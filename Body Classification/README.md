# Body-Parts-Classification

This is a prediction model that can predict the body parts of a human being from images. It can classify an image to either 'belly', 'Ear', 'Eye', 'hands', 'head', 'knee', 'legs', 'neck',
'nose', 'shoulders'.

## Datasets

The model is trained using the following dataset from Kaggle:

- [Body Parts Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/linkanjarad/body-parts-dataset)

## Methodology

The model was developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model.

## Libraries and Frameworks

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Scikit-Learn

## Results

- 91% accuracy
