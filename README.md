# Overview

Welcome to my Computer Vision Portfolio, showcasing a collection of projects that leverage the power of computer vision to solve real-world challenges.

## Projects

### 1. Skin Cancer Classification and Segementation
Overview: Classifying different skin cancer types, segmenting and the severity of the cancer(benign and malignant).
Aim: For faster identification of skin cancer cases even in their early stages and enable make informed decisions.
Technologies: Python, tensorflow, keras, Scikit-Learn

### 2. Body Part Classification
Overview: Classification of body parts based on  picture.
Aim: This is just an extension of skin disease classiication where by it could identify symptoms based on images eg skin rash but the part identified with the skin rash is the leg.
