# Overview

Welcome to my Computer Vision Portfolio, showcasing a collection of projects that leverage the power of computer vision to solve real-world challenges.

## Projects

### 1. Skin Cancer Classification and Segmentation
Overview: This project focuses on classifying various skin cancer types, segmenting affected areas, and determining cancer severity (benign or malignant).

Aim: To enable faster identification of skin cancer, even in its early stages, and support informed decision-making.

Technologies: Python, Tensorflow, Keras, and Scikit-Learn

### 2. Body Part Classification
Overview: Classification of body parts based on a picture.

Aim: This extends skin disease classification by identifying symptoms from images, such as detecting a skin rash and specifying the affected area (e.g., the leg).

Technologies: Python, Tensorflow, Keras, and Scikit-Learn.

### 3. Gender Classification
Overview: Gender classification based on images.

Aim: To develop a system capable of predicting age, gender, and race from images, supporting TeleHospital diagnosis.

Technologies: Python, Tensorflow, Keras, and Scikit-Learn.
